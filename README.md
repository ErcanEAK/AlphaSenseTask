Release Validator
Description
This program helps Bob to select the maximum number of releases possible within a sprint of 10 working days. It ensures that no two releases are validated at the same time, and each release must be completed within the sprint duration.

Requirements
Each release must be completed within the 10-day sprint. For example, if a release is delivered on day 9 and takes 3 days, it cannot be validated since the sprint ends on day 10.
Bob can only validate one release at a time. No parallel validation is allowed.
Release validation must start on the exact day it is delivered (it cannot be postponed).
Files
releases.txt: The input file that contains the release data. Each line represents a release with two values:

Day of the release (when it is delivered).
Duration of the release (how long it takes to validate).
Example of releases.txt content:
1 1
2 2
3 5
5 2
10 4

solution.txt: The output file generated by the program. It contains the list of releases that Bob can validate within the sprint. Each line includes:

The day the release starts.
The day the release ends.
Example of solution.txt output:
6
1 1
2 3
4 5
7 8
9 9
10 10

How It Works
Input Reading: The program reads the release data from the releases.txt file, where each release is defined by its start day and duration.

Sorting: The releases are sorted based on their finish day (start day + duration) to prioritize those that can be validated earliest.

Validation Check: The program checks each release to see if it can be completed within the sprint and if Bob is available to validate it (no overlaps).

Output: The valid releases are saved in the solution.txt file, showing the number of valid releases and their start and end days.

How to Run
Prepare the releases.txt file with the list of releases in the format: day duration.
Run the program in your Java environment. The program will read the releases.txt file, process the data, and generate the solution.txt file.
Open the solution.txt file to see which releases Bob can validate within the sprint.
Example
Input: releases.txt
1 1
2 2
3 5
5 2
10 4
Output: solution.txt
3
1 1
2 3
5 6

Notes
Make sure the input file (releases.txt) is in the correct format and placed in the same directory as the program.
The program currently does not support postponing release validation, but it validates releases based on the day they are delivered.
